📄 Talk to PDF: RAG-Based AI Research Assistant📌 Project OverviewTalk to PDF is a Generative AI application that allows users to upload technical documents (PDFs) and ask questions in natural language. The system analyzes the document content and provides accurate, context-aware answers.Unlike traditional LLM chatbots that "hallucinate" facts, this project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It grounds the AI's responses strictly in the provided document, ensuring high accuracy for academic and professional use cases.🚀 Key FeaturesZero-Dependency Retrieval: Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for sparse retrieval, eliminating the need for heavy vector databases or expensive embedding APIs.High-Speed Processing: Processes large PDFs in seconds on a standard CPU (Laptop).State-of-the-Art LLM: Powered by Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for reasoning and answer synthesis.Hallucination Control: The system explicitly answers only from the provided context.User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for a clean, responsive web UI.🛠️ Tech StackComponentTechnology UsedLanguagePython 3.12LLM (Generation)Google Gemini-1.5-FlashRetrieval MethodTF-IDF (Scikit-Learn)OrchestrationLangChain (LCEL)FrontendStreamlitPDF ProcessingPyPDF⚙️ Installation & SetupFollow these steps to run the project locally.1. PrerequisiteYou need a Google Gemini API Key. Get it for free here: Google AI Studio2. Clone the RepositoryBashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/talk-to-pdf.git
cd talk-to-pdf
3. Create a Virtual EnvironmentIt is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.Bash# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
4. Install DependenciesBashpip install streamlit langchain-google-genai langchain-community scikit-learn pypdf
🏃‍♂️ How to RunOpen the project folder in VS Code or Terminal.Run the Streamlit server:Bashstreamlit run app.py
The application will open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:8501.Paste your API Key in the code (line 18 of app.py) or keep it ready to enter if prompted.🧠 Methodology (How it Works)Ingestion: The user uploads a PDF. The system reads the file using PyPDFLoader.Chunking: The text is split into smaller chunks (2000 characters) using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.Retrieval (TF-IDF): instead of converting text to heavy vectors, the system indexes the chunks using statistical keyword frequency. When a user asks a question, the system finds the most statistically relevant chunks.Generation: The relevant chunks + the user question are sent to Gemini Flash, which formulates a human-like answer.📸 Screenshots(Add screenshots of your running app here for your report)Home Screen: Upload interface.Processing: Success message after TF-IDF indexing.Q&A: Example of a question and the AI's answer.🔮 Future ScopeMulti-File Support: Allowing users to query multiple PDFs simultaneously.Chat History: Implementing session memory so users can ask follow-up questions.Hybrid Search: Combining TF-IDF with Vector Search for even higher accuracy.Developed by: Ravi Kumar Pal (M.Tech CSE)
